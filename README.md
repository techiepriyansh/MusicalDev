# MusicalDev
Some experiments in programmatic music production.

# PyPiano
A short library for basic music theory applications written on top of simpleaudio.
Is terminated due to inability of simpleaudio to play lower frequencies (< 170 Hz) clearly.
But nonetheless, the frequencies library created for its production is quite useful.

# WorkingWithMidi
Now, the attention has been switched towards producing music via MIDI production.
This is an attempt showcasing some fun ways to create melodies in the realm of mathematics!

# NumberMusic
A Graphical User Interface for creating melodies (in form of MIDI files) just by typing out degrees of 
the chosen (major) key!
